        hello, friends.

        <br> <br>

        My name is Caleb Myers. I'm an aspiring software developer in the UNCC
        Coding Bootcamp. I went to college and studied English Literature, but
        toward the end of my program I became interested in programming. Ever
        since writing my first "hello, world" I've been hooked.

        <br> <br>

        My studies in English improved my writing, analysis, and creative thinking.
        These skills combined with a love for technology and figuring out how things
        work have made programming a newfound passion of mine. I hope to take this
        time to learn, and eventually work on great projects.

        <br> <br>

        Apart from programming, my main interests lie in music, movies, and video
        games. I love all sorts of Rock, Electronic, and Hip-hop music, while some
        of my favorites are Gorillaz, Incubus, deadmau5, MGMT, Pretty Lights and \
        so much more. Some of my favorite movies are Dazed and Confused,
        Orange County, There Will Be Blood, and Pulp Fiction. Video games have been a
        huge part of my life ever since I first started playing on a Nintendo 64.
        Some all time favorites are Final Fantasy X, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,
        and World of Warcraft.
